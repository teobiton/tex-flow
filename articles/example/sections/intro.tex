\section{Introduction}

I am an example document.
I can for example call my own name : \docname. % Defined in temp/examples/examples.tex (generated at compile time)
But it's better to call my title: \doctitle. % Defined in articles/examples/infos.tex
I can use acronyms like \gls{yolo}. % Acronym entries are in common/acronyms.tex
I was written by \docauthor, for \cite{marge}. % Bibliography is in common/Bibliography.bib
