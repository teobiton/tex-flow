# tex-flow

tex-flow is a LuaTex flow meant to ease the life of people using LaTeX.
The purpose is to regroup common templates for conferences or university work and compile sources independently of the template used.

## Installation

In order to use the full functionnalities of this flow, several dependancies must be met:

```
sudo apt-get install git librsvg2-bin texlive-full make
```

`rsvg-convert` installed with `librsvg2-bin` turns SVG files into PDF, PS, or SVG vector images. (see [man](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/rsvg-convert.1.html))

## Usage

## Contribute

This flow is meant to be evolutive, in the sense that there is no limit to the number of classes/templates that can be defined.
The base functionality was done for our research objectives.
To contribute, you can either open [Issues](https://github.com/teobiton/tex-flow/issues) if you think of cool improvements, or open [Pull Requests](https://github.com/teobiton/tex-flow/pulls) to implement them yourself!
