# Figures Folder

This folder contains schematics for the design part.
It is not necessary to export the .svg files (ex: drawio) in .pdf as it is done
automatically when compiling the report. 
Only files with extention .draw.svg will be converted in PDF.


## Extension convention

ALL drawio files must RESPECT the naming convention and end with the following extension:

```
*.drawio.svg
```

## Possible issue
Make sure to export the text as vectorial in your svg file.
If you encounter an issue with drawio, please see this [article](https://www.diagrams.net/doc/faq/svg-export-text-problems) "Why text in exported SVG images may not display correctly".
